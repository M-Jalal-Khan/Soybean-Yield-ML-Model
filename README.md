Project Description
This project focuses on predicting soybean seed yield per unit area (SYUA) using a dataset that includes critical agronomic features. The model was developed using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, achieving impressive results (R² = 1.0 for Random Forest and R² = 0.98 for Gradient Boosting). By understanding the relationships between these features, the project aims to improve agricultural productivity, providing farmers with data-driven strategies to boost crop yield.

Data
The dataset consists of 55,450 entries with the following features:

Plant Height (PH)
Biological Weight (BW)
Protein Content (PCO)
Number of Pods (NP)
Seed Yield per Unit Area (SYUA) (target variable)
The dataset explores how these agronomic traits correlate with soybean yield, enabling the development of a robust predictive model.

Data Analysis and Modeling Steps
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions and correlations.
Identify the most influential features for predicting yield.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluate performance using metrics such as R², MAE, and MSE.
Compare models and optimize the best one.
Model Performance:

Random Forest: R² = 1 (perfect prediction).
Gradient Boosting: R² = 0.98 (strong predictive accuracy).
Insights and Recommendations
Key Findings: Biological weight and protein content are the strongest predictors of seed yield.
Actionable Insights:
Farmers should focus on optimizing biological weight and protein content to increase yield.
