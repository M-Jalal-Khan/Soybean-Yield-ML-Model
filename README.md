## Project Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict soybean seed yield per unit area (SYUA) using a dataset that includes agronomic features such as plant height, biological weight, and protein content. The goal is to develop a model that can assist farmers in optimizing farming practices, increasing yield, and contributing to food security and sustainability.

## Data

The dataset contains various agronomic features that impact soybean yield, such as:

- **Plant Height (PH)**
- **Biological Weight (BW)**
- **Protein Content (PCO)**
- **Number of Pods (NP)**
- **Seed Yield per Unit Area (SYUA)** (target variable)

The dataset consists of 55,450 entries, providing detailed information on how these features correlate with soybean yield.

## Data Analysis and Modeling Steps

The analysis and modeling process involves the following steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistency in model performance.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize distributions of key agronomic metrics (e.g., plant height, protein content).
- Analyze correlations between features and the target variable (seed yield).
- Identify trends or patterns that can inform the modeling process.

### 3. Feature Engineering and Selection

- Perform feature selection to identify the most important variables for predicting yield.
- Engineer new features or transformations to improve model accuracy.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

- Train models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluate models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and RÂ².
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### 5. Data Visualization

- Create visualizations (e.g., feature importance plots, bar charts, confusion matrices) to illustrate key findings and model performance.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the model's results, the following insights and recommendations are provided:

- **Key Predictors**: Biological weight and protein content are the most significant factors in predicting seed yield.
- **Actionable Insights for Farmers**: Focus on optimizing biological weight and protein content to improve yield.
- **Research Focus**: Future research should focus on genetic optimization of key traits for higher yield potential.
- **Policy Implications**: Encourage investment in research to develop more productive soybean varieties.
